## Google Drive List

1. Create a Google Sheet.
2. Open the menu *Tools* and select *Script editor*.
3. Paste and save the content of *Coge.gs* in the newly opened window.
4. If you want to list file contributors, open the menu *Resources*, select *Advanced Google services...*, switch on the *Drive API* (v2), and click *OK*.
5. Go back to the spreadsheet and reload the page.
6. Use the menu *Google Drive files* to generate the list. If your Drive contains a large number of files, you can use the menu item *List files with triggers*. Executions will then be triggered automatically every 10 minutes until the completion of the list.
